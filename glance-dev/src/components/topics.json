        "promises": {"info" : "In JavaScript, promises are a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations. They represent the outcome of an asynchronous task, such as fetching data or executing a function, and simplify the management of success or failure. Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected, transitioning from pending to either fulfilled or rejected upon completion. They streamline the organization of asynchronous code and offer methods like then() for handling success and catch() for managing errors, contributing to cleaner and more readable code."},
        "arrowFunction": {"info" : "In JavaScript, arrow functions provide a concise and simplified syntax for writing anonymous functions. Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), arrow functions offer a more compact alternative to traditional function expressions. They have a shorthand syntax, omitting the need for the function keyword and allowing for implicit returns for single expressions. Arrow functions also adopt the lexical scoping of this, meaning they inherit the this value from the surrounding code. This behavior can help alleviate common issues with traditional function expressions and their dynamic scoping. Arrow functions are particularly useful for short, one-off functions and have become a widely adopted feature in modern JavaScript code for its brevity and clarity."},
        "modules": {"info" : "In JavaScript, modules allow you to organize code by breaking it into separate files. They use import and export statements to share functionality between files, promoting code modularity and maintainability. Modules help avoid global namespace clutter, making it easier to manage and collaborate on projects."}

        "hooks": {"info" : "In React, hooks are functions that empower functional components with state and side effect management. Introduced in React 16.8, hooks like useState handle state, and useEffect manages side effects, bringing functionality traditionally associated with class components to functional ones. Hooks streamline component logic, offering a concise and readable alternative to class-based approaches. They are now a standard and essential part of React development."},
        "stateProps": {"info" : "In React, state manages a component's internal data using the useState hook. Props, short for properties, are parameters passed from a parent to a child component for communication and customization. State handles internal data, while props facilitate data flow between components."},

SQL is standard for relational database management systems such as MySQL and PostgreSQL."},
        "noSQL": {"info" : "NoSQL refers to a category of databases, standing for 'not only SQL'. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases offer flexibility in data storage by not strictly adhering to a fixed schema.

In this model, the program responds to events as they occur, allowing for dynamic and reactive behavior. JavaScript, especially in web development, is often used for event-driven programming. For example, user interactions like clicks or keypresses trigger events that JavaScript can handle, enabling interactive and responsive applications"}

ARC keeps track of references to objects, ensuring memory is appropriately managed to prevent leaks. While ARC simplifies memory management, developers should be cautious of strong reference cycles, where objects reference each other, potentially leading to memory issues. Swift provides tools like weak and unowned references to address such situations"},
